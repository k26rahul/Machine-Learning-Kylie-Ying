## Projects

1. MAGIC Gamma Telescope: Classification
   - [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope): Simulated high-energy gamma particle registration in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope.
   - Target: Classifying whether the detected particles are high-energy gamma particles.

2. Seoul Bike Sharing Demand: Regression
   - [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand): Public bike rental counts per hour in Seoul with weather and holiday data.
   - Target: Predicting the count of public bicycle rentals per hour.

3. Seeds: Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
   - [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds): Geometrical properties of wheat kernels from three varieties, measured using a soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package.
   - Target: Clustering the wheat kernels based on their geometrical properties.
